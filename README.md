🔭 **Currently working on:** Softtek

🌱 **Currently learning:** Python

💬 **Ask me about:** my passions

😄 **Pronouns:** She

## Who am I? 🤓
I am a Fullstack Programmer oriented to Fullstack design. Passionate about technology, I enjoy working with code.

## What do I do? 👩‍💻
Currently, I am dedicated to carrying out projects that allow me to advance my training as a programmer. I love being able to find the solution to life's problems with code.

## Where am I headed? ✈️
My main goal is to impact the world with code 🎆. I don't just enjoy programming because of the demand in the market, but I am really passionate about broadening my perspective of the things that exist in the world and finding new solutions to problems that we thought were already solved.

## What technologies do I use? ⚛️
Henry's Bootcamp has allowed me to acquire the fundamental knowledge and experience to get off the ground 🚀. So the main technologies I use are:
- Javascript
- React.js
- Next.js
- Node.js
- Express.js
- PostgreSQL
- Sequelize
- GIT
- Clearly including HTML and CSS.
- Python
- UIpath
- Power Automate
- ABAP
- coming soon... AWS (I want to study it because I want to save money😂) 

## 🚀📲 Don't hesitate to contact me!
Together we can carry out a great project that changes the lives of thousands of people. 📲🚀
